# ML_Project-Diabetes_Prediction

This project explores the task of predicting diabetes onset using SVM, a powerful machine learning technique. By analyzing medical data, the model aims to distinguish between individuals who are likely to develop diabetes and those who are not.

## Data
This directory stores the diabetes dataset, typically in CSV format. The dataset contains features such as:

- **id** (unique identifier for each patient)
- **Pregnancies** (number of pregnancies)
- **Glucose** (glucose level)
- **BloodPressure** (blood pressure value)
- **SkinThickness** (skin thickness measurement)
- **Insulin** (insulin level)
- **BMI** (Body Mass Index)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction** (a function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history)
- **Age** (age of the patient)
- **Outcome** (0 for no diabetes, 1 for diabetes)

> **Note:** You might need to adjust this list based on your specific dataset.

## Notebooks
This directory contains the Jupyter Notebook (`diabetes_prediction.ipynb`) for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Running the Project
The Jupyter Notebook (`diabetes_prediction.ipynb`) guides you through the following steps:

### Data Loading and Exploration:
- Loads the diabetes dataset.
- Explores data distribution, identifying missing values and basic statistics.

### Data Preprocessing:
- Handles missing values (e.g., imputation).
- Normalizes or scales numerical features.
- Encodes categorical variables if necessary.

### Feature Engineering (Optional):
- Creates additional features (e.g., interactions between features).
- Analyzes correlations between features and the target variable.

### Model Training with Support Vector Machine:
- Trains the model, potentially tuning hyperparameters for improved performance.

### Model Evaluation:
- Evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Visualization of Results:
- Analyzes the confusion matrix to understand model performance on different categories.
- Visualizes feature importance to explore the impact of specific features on model predictions.

## Text Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
The project focuses on techniques like:
- Normalizing numerical values (e.g., Min-Max scaling).
- Creating dummy variables for categorical features.
- Applying techniques to handle imbalanced datasets, if necessary.

## Customization
Modify the Jupyter Notebook to:
- Experiment with different preprocessing techniques and feature engineering methods.
- Try other classification algorithms for comparison (e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Machines).
- Explore advanced techniques like deep learning models specifically designed for medical prediction.

## Further Contributions
Extend this project by:
- Incorporating additional health metrics or data from electronic health records.
- Implementing a real-time diabetes prediction system using a trained model and an API.
- Exploring explainability techniques to understand the reasoning behind the model's predictions.

By leveraging SVM and medical data processing techniques, we can analyze health metrics and potentially build a model to predict diabetes onset. This project provides a foundation for further exploration in diabetes prediction and health monitoring.
